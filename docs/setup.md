# Pipeline setup and configuration
There are a number of main files that rule the pipeline's execution:

* Snakefile
* common.smk
* config.yaml
* resources.yaml
* samples.tsv
* units.tsv

There is more general information about the content of these files in hydra-genetics documentation in [code standards](https://hydra-genetics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development/standards/), [config](https://hydra-genetics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/make_pipeline/config/) and [Snakefile](https://hydra-genetics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/make_pipeline/import/).

## Snakefile
The `Snakefile` is located in `workflow/` and imports hydra-genetics modules and rules as well as modifies these rules when needed. 
It also imports pipeline specific rules and define rule orders. Finally, this is where the `rule all` is defined.

## common.smk
The `common.smk` is located under `workflow/rules/`. 
This is a general rule taking care of any actions that are not directly connected with running a specific program. 
It includes version checks, import of config, resources, tsv-files and validations using schemas. 
Functions used by pipeline-specific rules are also defined here as well as the output files using the function **compile_output_list** which programmatically generates a list of all necessary output files for the module to be targeted in the all rule defined in the `Snakemake` file. 
See further [Result files](https://hydra-genetics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/make_pipeline/results/).

## config.yaml
The `config.yaml` is located under `config/`. 
The file ties all the inputs, outputs and other dependencies as well as parameters for different rules together.
See further [pipeline configuration](https://hydra-genetics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/make_pipeline/config/).

## resources.yaml
The `resources.yaml` is located under `config/`. 
The file declares default resources used by rules as well as resources for specific rules that need more than allocated by default. 
See further [pipeline configuration](https://hydra-genetics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/make_pipeline/config/).

## CNV-report configuration
The interactive CNV HTML report (`hydra-genetics/reports` module, `cnv_html_report`/`merge_cnv_json` rules) reads two additional config-referenced files under `config/`:

* `config/cytoBand.hg38.txt` — UCSC cytoband definitions for hg38, referenced by `merge_cnv_json.cytobands` in `config.yaml`. Displays cytobands in the report's chromosome plot; requires `cnv_html_report.cytobands: true` to be enabled.
* `config/filters/table_filter.yaml` — defines named CNV classification/filter groups (e.g. amplification, deletion, LOH) used to populate the results table's **Type** column and its "filtered" toggle, referenced by `merge_cnv_json.table_filter_config`. Each group is a tree of `any_of`/`all_of`/`not` conditions over fields such as `adjusted_cn`, `baf`, `length`, and `caller`; thresholds are clinical choices and should be tuned rather than used as shipped.

See the full syntax reference in the `reports` module's own docs: [CNV report configuration](https://hydra-genetics-reports.readthedocs.io/en/v2.0.0/cnv_report/) (pinned to the same version as `module_versions.reports` in `config.yaml`).


## profile.yaml
Profiles are saved as yaml files to control how snakemake will be executed, if jobs will be submitted
to a cluster, use singularity, restart on failure and so forth. It also forwards requested resources to *drmaa* using
a drmaa variable.

### Default resources (example)

```yaml
default_resources:
  threads: 1
  time: "4:00:00"
  mem_mb: 6144
  mem_per_cpu: 6144
  partition: "low"
```

### Snakemake settings (example)

```yaml
jobs: 100
keep-going: True
restart-times: 2
rerun-incomplete: True
use-singularity: True
configfile: "config/config.yaml"
singularity-args: "-e --cleanenv -B /projects -B /data -B /beegfs
```

### `drmaa` settings (example)

```yaml
drmaa: " -A wp1 -N 1-1 -t {resources.time} -n {resources.threads} --mem={resources.mem_mb} --mem-per-cpu={resources.mem_per_cpu} --mem-per-cpu={resources.mem_per_cpu} --partition={resources.partition} -J {rule} -e slurm_out/{rule}_%j.err -o slurm_out/{rule}_%j.out"
drmaa-log-dir: "slurm_out"
default-resources: [threads=1, time="04:00:00", partition="low", mem_mb="3074", mem_per_cpu="3074"]
```

## Input files
The `samples.tsv` and `units.tsv` are input files that must be generated before running the pipeline and should in general be located in the base folder of the analysis folder, can be changed in the `config.yaml`. See further [running the pipeline](running.md) and [create input files](https://hydra-genetics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/run_pipeline/create_sample_files/).

### Samples file (TSV)

```tsv
sample	tumor_content
MM0001	0.8
MM0002	0.8
```
